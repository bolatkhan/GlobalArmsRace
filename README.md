# GlobalArmsRace
The final project for Data Analytics Bootcamp at Spiced Academy


1. Title and Objectives: Export and Import Volumes of Major Arms by Leading Suppliers and Recipients in the Cold War and Post–Cold War Periods

I analyzed 70+ years of arms transfer data from SIPRI's database, revealing how geopolitical shocks dramatically change trade patterns:
🔧 My Process:
Built Python/Pandas pipelines to clean and analyze SIPRI TIV data
Created interactive Tableau dashboards tracking exporter/receiver trends
Identified key tipping points in global arms markets
💡 Striking Findings:
🇺🇸 U.S. arms exports surged after 9/11 (peaking at 39% global share)
🇺🇦 Ukraine became the world's #1 arms importer after Russia's 2022 invasion
🇮🇳 India maintained its position as top importer since Cold War era
🇷🇺 Russian exports began declining sharply from 2018 (before Ukraine war)



Figures are in millions of SIPRI trend-indicator values (TIVs).
