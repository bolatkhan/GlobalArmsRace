# GlobalArmsRace
The final project for Data Analytics Bootcamp at Spiced Academy


Title and Objectives: Export and Import Volumes of Major Arms by Leading Suppliers and Recipients in the Cold War and Postâ€“Cold War Periods

I analyzed 70+ years of arms transfer data from SIPRI's database, revealing how geopolitical shocks dramatically change trade patterns:
ðŸ”§ My Process:

- Built Python/Pandas pipelines to clean and analyze SIPRI TIV data
- Created interactive Tableau dashboards tracking exporter/receiver trends
- Identified key tipping points in global arms markets

ðŸ’¡ Striking Findings:
- U.S. arms exports surged after 9/11 (peaking at 39% global share)
- Ukraine became the world's #1 arms importer after Russia's 2022 invasion
- India maintained its position as top importer since Cold War era
- Russian exports began declining sharply from 2018 (before Ukraine war)



Figures are in millions of SIPRI trend-indicator values (TIVs).
