# GlobalArmsRace
The final project for Data Analytics Bootcamp at Spiced Academy


1. Title and Objectives

Global Arms Race: This project aims to analyze the evolution of defense spending worldwide, with a focus on geopolitical drivers, arms trade, and the trade-off between defense and other development spendings purticularliy development aid.

Broad Research question: 
How have global defense spending trends evolved since the end of the Cold War, the geopolitical drivers, arms trade and the trade offs.

2. Spicific Policy-Relevant Questions

   We are primarily conecrned with the the follwoing research questions: 

   1. How has global defense spending evolved over since the end of cold war (1990-2024)?

   2. How do the geopolitical factors correlate with the change in defense spending - identify the major turning points (e.g., NATO accession, the war in Ukraine, Ukraine War, Afghanistan War, the Gulf War, Middle east, US-China competition...etc)? How do NATO and non-NATO military expenditures compare?

   3. Which countries are becoming the fastest growing military power in the world (both in terms of nuclear weapons, military capability as well as defense spending?) 
   
   4. What are the trends in arms trade (arms exports and arms imports)? Who sells the most? who buys the most? How do arms trade patterns shift with geopolitical factors (alliance and conflicts)?

   5. How does Defense Spending Compare with other spending (Health and Education)?

   6. How does Defense Spending compare with ODA? Do we see a declining trend for Aid and rising trend for Arms? Does the increase in Defense Spending come at the cost of global development efforts (military over diplomacy)?

   7. For which countries militarisation and funding arms remains a high priority (e.g., looking at the milexp share of total govt expenditure for the top spenders)?
   
   8. Which regions are becoming more miliatrised in the world?

   9. Are we in a new global arms race in the world?

   3. Datasets:

   - Defense Spending → Annual spending by country on military both in total constants and % GDP (SIPRI, NATO, World Bank, OECD, IISS military Balance)
   - Arms Trade → Exports/imports of weapons (SIPRI, UNROCA, WB)
   - Official Development Assisstance (ODA) -> annual committment by country (donor and maybe also reciepient) in total constant and % GDP (World Bank, OECD)
